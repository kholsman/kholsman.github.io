<p>This project represents a comprehensive, collaborative effort to characterize climate-change effects on the Bering Sea ecosystem, from physics to fisheries, and to understand how different fisheries management approaches might attenuate or amplify climate driven changes to fish and shellfish biomass.</p>

<p><img src="https://kholsman.github.io/ACLIM_site/images/Slide01.png" alt="ACLIM Overview"></p>

<p>This 3 year, $750,000 project brings together climate, ecosystem, and fishery management experts from NOAA AFSC, NOAA PMEL, and the University of Washington JISAO to quantify the interacting effects of global emissions, climate change, natural variability, and fisheries in order to project how fish and fisheries might change under future climate conditions and emissions scenarios. This project provides a proof-of-concept implementation of a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) framework for evaluating the performance of resource management strategies under different climate change scenarios. We will apply the framework to several fish and invertebrate species from the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS), for which changes in productivity have been linked to climate variability. We will evaluate the following questions with this work: </p>

<ol>
<li>How will climate change impact the productivity (in terms of biomass, growth, and recruitment) and survival of key species?</li>
<li>Are current fishery management approaches robust to climate-driven changes or should additional alternative harvest control rules be used?</li>
<li>What is the expected change in future fishable biomass and recommended harvest rates under climate change? </li>
</ol>

<p>We will also test software for rapid uptake of Global Climate Model (GCM) output into regional ocean circulation models as a demonstration project for the Bering Sea Large Marine Ecosystem and develop and test a framework for evaluating climate change effects on fish and fisheries that will be of global interest. Lastly, we will conduct annual webinars and a workshop (year 3) aimed at applying the framework to other NOAA LMEs and synthesizing our results for application to the 2021 IPCC AR6 evaluation of climate change effect on marine ecosystems and marine dependent human communities.</p>

<p>. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

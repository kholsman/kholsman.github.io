<p>This project represents a comprehensive, collaborative effort to characterize climate-change effects on the Bering Sea ecosystem, from physics to fisheries, and to understand how different fisheries management approaches might attenuate or amplify climate driven changes to fish and shellfish biomass.</p>

<p><img src="https://kholsman.github.io/ACLIM_site/images/BottomTemp.pdf" alt="ACLIM Overview"></p>

<p>This 3 year, $750,000 project brings together climate, ecosystem, and fishery management experts from NOAA AFSC, NOAA PMEL, and the University of Washington JISAO to quantify the interacting effects of global emissions, climate change, natural variability, and fisheries in order to project how fish and fisheries might change under future climate conditions and emissions scenarios. This project provides a proof-of-concept implementation of a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) framework for evaluating the performance of resource management strategies under different climate change scenarios. We will apply the framework to several fish and invertebrate species from the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS), for which changes in productivity have been linked to climate variability. We will evaluate the following questions with this work: </p>

<ol>
<li>How will climate change impact the productivity (in terms of biomass, growth, and recruitment) and survival of key species?</li>
<li>Are current fishery management approaches robust to climate-driven changes or should additional alternative harvest control rules be used?</li>
<li>What is the expected change in future fishable biomass and recommended harvest rates under climate change? </li>
</ol>

<p>We will also test software for rapid uptake of Global Climate Model (GCM) output into regional ocean circulation models as a demonstration project for the Bering Sea Large Marine Ecosystem and develop and test a framework for evaluating climate change effects on fish and fisheries that will be of global interest. Lastly, we will conduct annual webinars and a workshop (year 3) aimed at applying the framework to other NOAA LMEs and synthesizing our results for application to the 2021 IPCC AR6 evaluation of climate change effect on marine ecosystems and marine dependent human communities.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/">NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL)</a> produced downscaled climate forecasts from three global climate models for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) and has produced 2 downscaled climate forecasts from the IPCC AR5 report; these are available to project collaborators via the <a href="https://github.com/kholsman/ACLIM/ACLIM_data/ROMS_NPZ_queries">ACLIM data repository</a> (see direct links on left). For each of these projections, boundary conditions for the ROMS-NPZ coupled model were driven by regional downscaled outputs from the following global climate models (Hermann et al. in press):</p>

<p>Developed by the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, the <a href="http://www.cccma.ec.gc.ca/diagnostics/cgcm3/cgcm3.shtml">CCCma<a/> model is also known as the CGCM3/T47 model. This model showed the greatest warming over time compared to other models tested by PMEL.

<p>(2006-2100; AR5 RCP 4.5) </p>
<p><a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/earth-system-model">The GFDL (RCP 4.5) model</a>: The NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (<a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov">GFDL</a>) has lead development of the first Earth System Models (ESMs), which like physical climate models, are based on an atmospheric circulation model coupled with an oceanic circulation model, with representations of land, sea ice and iceberg dynamics; ESMs additionally incorporate interactive biogeochemistry, including the carbon cycle. The ESM2M model used in this project is an evolution of the prototype EMS2.1 model, where pressure-based vertical coordinates are used along the developmental path of GFDL’s Modular Ocean Model version 4.1 and where the land model is more adavanced (LM3) than in the previous ESM2.1.</p>
